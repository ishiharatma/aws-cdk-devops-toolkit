- üöÄ Automated deployment of Lambda functions
- üîÑ CI/CD pipeline construction examples
- üèó Infrastructure as Code implementations
- ‚öô Automation samples for operational tasks

## Getting Started

1. Checkout the repository and initialize the project

1-1. Checkout a repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ishiharatma/aws-cdk-devops-toolkit.git
cd aws-cdk-devops-toolkit
```

1-2. Initializing a project

Install the required libraries for Node.js.

```sh
# install dependencies
npm ci
```

2. Set your AWS CLI credentials

AWS credentials (API keys) are required to deploy the CDK. Here's the simplest way to use permanent credentials.

This method is mainly used in development environments. An example AWS CLI profile is below.

~/.aws/credentials

```text
[<project name>-<environment>-accesskey]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = YYYYYYYYYYYYYY
region = ap-northeast-1

[<project name>-<environment>]
region = ap-northeast-1
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/<role name>
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/<username>
source_profile=<project name>-<environment>-accesskey
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run cdk:diff:all -w workspaces/<workspace name> --env=<environment> --project=<project name>
npm run cdk:deploy:all -w workspaces/<workspace name> --env=<environment> --project=<project name>
npm run cdk:destroy:all -w workspaces/<workspace name> --env=<environment> --project=<project name>
```
